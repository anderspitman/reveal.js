              Well do I remember my most unique “deed” to sustain a prophet. As a
              medical doctor and cardiac surgeon, I had the responsibility of
              performing open-heart surgery on President Spencer W. Kimball in
              1972, when he was Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve
              Apostles. He needed a very complex operation. But I had no

              experience doing such a procedure on a 77-year-old patient in heart
              failure. I did not recommend the operation and so informed
              President Kimball and the First Presidency. But, in faith,
              President Kimball chose to have the operation, only because it was
              advised by the First Presidency. That shows how he sustained his
              leaders! And his decision made me tremble!

              Thanks to the Lord, the operation was a success. When President
              Kimball’s heart resumed beating, it did so with great power! At
              that very moment, I had a clear witness of the Spirit that this man
              would one day become President of the Church!

            Twenty-six years before he became President of the Church,
            then-Elder George Albert Smith said:
            <blockquote>
              “The obligation that we make when we raise our hands … is a most
              sacred one. It does not mean that we will go quietly on our way
              and be willing that the prophet of the Lord shall direct this
              work, but it means … that we will stand behind him; we will pray
              for him; we will defend his good name, and we will strive to
              carry out his instructions as the Lord shall direct.”
            </blockquote>
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <blockquote>
"The Church today has been organized by the Lord Himself. He has put in place a remarkable system of governance that provides redundancy and backup. That system provides for prophetic leadership even when the inevitable illnesses and incapacities may come with advancing age. Counterbalances and safeguards abound so that no one can ever lead the Church astray"
