"Imagine the privilege the Lord has given us of sustaining His prophet, whose counsel will be untainted, unvarnished, unmotivated by any personal aspiration, and utterly true! How do we really sustain a prophet? Long before he became President of the Church, President Joseph F. Smith explained, “It is an important duty resting upon the Saints who … sustain the authorities of the Church, to do so not only by the lifting of the hand, the mere form, but in deed and in truth.”"

              Well do I remember my most unique “deed” to sustain a prophet. As a
              medical doctor and cardiac surgeon, I had the responsibility of
              performing open-heart surgery on President Spencer W. Kimball in
              1972, when he was Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve
              Apostles. He needed a very complex operation. But I had no

              failure. I did not recommend the operation and so informed
              President Kimball and the First Presidency. But, in faith,
              President Kimball chose to have the operation, only because it was
              advised by the First Presidency. That shows how he sustained his
              leaders! And his decision made me tremble!

              Thanks to the Lord, the operation was a success. When President
              Kimball’s heart resumed beating, it did so with great power! At
              that very moment, I had a clear witness of the Spirit that this man

            Twenty-six years before he became President of the Church,
            then-Elder George Albert Smith said:
            <blockquote>
              “The obligation that we make when we raise our hands … is a most
              sacred one. It does not mean that we will go quietly on our way
              and be willing that the prophet of the Lord shall direct this
              work, but it means … that we will stand behind him; we will pray
              for him; we will defend his good name, and we will strive to
              carry out his instructions as the Lord shall direct.”

men—prophets, seers, and revelators—know what the will of the Lord is when
unanimity is reached! They are committed to see that the Lord’s will truly will

responsibilities a wide variety of experience and background. When matters come

fascinating to witness the power of the Holy Spirit influence these men.
Initial differences never sharp but nonetheless perceptible soften and meld
